# WordPress-Theme-Detect
Detect WordPress theme used on a website

To display the form on a page or post, you can use the following shortcode:

```[theme-checker]```

The form will allow anyone to enter a WordPress website URL and check the active theme name on that website, including information from the WordPress.org repository if available.
